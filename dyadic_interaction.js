    <p style='text-align:left'>Back at your research facility, you are working with fellow anthropologists to uncover more information about the language of this remote mountain village community. Together, you practice communicating in their language in order to understand it better.\
    <p style='text-align:left'>In this part of the experiment, you will be paired up with another participant of this experiment to play a communication game.</p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>In this game, you will see more greetings between members of the community. Like before, sometimes part of the greeting will be obscured, \
    and sometimes the person being greeted will be obscured. </p>",

    "<h3>Part Three: Communicating with a partner</h3>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>The communication game will have 64 rounds. In each round, one partner plays the director role and one plays the matcher role. Roles will swap after each round.\
    <p style='text-align:left'>The director will see the person speaking the greeting and the person being greeted, but part of the greeting will be obscured. It is their job to \
    choose the word that best identifies the person being greeted in this context, and send it to their partner.</p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>The matcher will then be sent the same greeting image, but with the person being greeted obscured. \
    They will have to choose who was being greeted based on who the greeter is and what word their partner chose to help them identify the greetee.</p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>Don't worry if you can't remember all of the greetings you learned. If the matcher chooses the correct person, the pair wins the round \
    regardless of which greeting was chosen by the director.</p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>Both partners will receive feedback after each round, so you'll be able to see what you get right and where you make mistakes.",
