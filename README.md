# kinship-dissertation
This repo contains all the code written by Maisy Hallam for her Linguistics MSc dissertation, "Investigating the communicative efficiency of kinship terminology", in Summer 2021.

These files comprise all the code and images necessary to build the experiment we ran for this study. Note that communicative_function.py is not experiment code; it calculates a communicative
cost score for each language (useful after data collection).

To run this code, the user will also need the latest copy of the JSPsych library, available from https://www.jspsych.org/.

The file websocket_server.zip is NOT my intellectual property. It is just necessary for the interactive element of the experiment to work. This is attributed to https://github.com/Pithikos/python-websocket-server.
